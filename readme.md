Listen to an NP-Complete Problem
====

The task of finding whether

![integrate product of cosines](https://i.imgur.com/HtOPQQO.gif)

is true or not, for a corresponding to a set of a's, corresponds to a solution of the [number partition problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_problem) and therefore is NP-complete [Plaisted]. Therefore, listening to a product of cosines scaled by a set of integers corresponds very literally to listening to an NP-complete problem. In this git repo is a generator for number partition problems and the product of cosine problems related to these, and the conversion to sounds.

In the section of the parameter space I've explored, they mostly sound like laundry machines. The mp3 files are some representative examples.
