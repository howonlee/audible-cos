Listen to an NP-Complete Problem
====

The task of finding whether

![integrate product of cosines](https://i.imgur.com/HtOPQQO.gif)

is true or not, for a corresponding to a set of a's, corresponds to a solution of the number partition problem and therefore is NP-complete. Therefore, listening to a product of cosines scaled by a set of integers corresponds to listening to an NP-complete problem. Let's listen to that.
